# Metadata Transfer

## State
Development done.

## Aim
This program's aim was to parse data from Calibre books to insert them in a MySql database and move the files on my external drive.

## Cons
* Getting the data from calibre can take hours ;
* I didn't create the script for the MySql database, which I have lost btw.

## Consequence
* Will try a new implementation with getting data from bnf and library of congress to see if I can cut times on metadata ;
* Will set a, improved a completed script for an sqlite database instead of mysql ;
* Will attach a UI to it to make the checking of books more convenients.
